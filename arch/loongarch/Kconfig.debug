	help
	  This determines which method will be used for unwinding kernel stack
	  traces for panics, oopses, bugs, warnings, perf, /proc/<pid>/stack,
	  livepatch, lockdep, and more.

config UNWINDER_GUESS
	bool "Guess unwinder"
	help
	  This option enables the "guess" unwinder for unwinding kernel stack
	  traces.  It scans the stack and reports every kernel text address it
	  finds.  Some of the addresses it reports may be incorrect.

config UNWINDER_PROLOGUE
	bool "Prologue unwinder"
	depends on KALLSYMS
	help
	  This option enables the "prologue" unwinder for unwinding kernel stack
	  traces.  It unwind the stack frame based on prologue code analyze.  Symbol
	  information is needed, at least the address and length of each function.
	  Some of the addresses it reports may be incorrect.

	default n
	help
	  If you want to add compressed kernel support to a new board, and the
	  board supports uart16550 compatible serial port, please select
	  SYS_SUPPORTS_ZBOOT_UART16550 for your board and enable this option to
	  debug it.

	  If your board doesn't support uart16550 compatible serial port, you
	  can try to select SYS_SUPPORTS_ZBOOT and use the other methods to
	  debug it. for example, add a new serial port support just as
	  arch/loongarch/boot/compressed/uart-16550.c does.

	  After the compressed kernel support works, please disable this option
	  to reduce the kernel image size and speed up the booting procedure a
	  little.
